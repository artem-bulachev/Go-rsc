# golang-web-app
Web app skeleton in Go I am building not only to learn the language, but also help others new to Go.  Open to peer reviews and security audits.

Lots of work to do.  CSRF Tokens are issued, but not actually used anywhere yet.

Currently you can create an account, login, and logout.

If you decide to commit, please refrain from using 3rd party frameworks or web libraries where possible.  I am using Julien Schmidt's httprouter, but that's as far as I want to stray away from the standard library (if possible).
